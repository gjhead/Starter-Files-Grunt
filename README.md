Starter Files / Basic

These (along with many of my other github starter files) are put here just for my own memory/usage.  These are not organized or optimized for public consumption - and are just a place for me to start.

I update these a LOT and most likely what is here on github may be out of date or missing something.  I usually update these a bit with every project I work on.

These files are for a specific vanilla project.  sass, grunt workflow
