Starter Files / Basic

These (along with many of my other github starter files) are put here just for my own memory/usage.  These are not organized or optimized for public consumption - and are just a place for me to start.

I update these a LOT and most likely what is here on github may be out of date or missing something.  I usually update these a bit with every project I work on.

These files are for a specific vanilla project.  

Uses grunt for workflow and the following:

CSS: Sass, Autoprefixr (viz postcss)
JS: jshint for linting and uglifier for minification.
html: .kit for --very simple-- templating with little to no overhead.

Notes:

I do not like automating image minification, feel it's better to do this individually for best results.
